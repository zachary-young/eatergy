      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        Students from Health and Wellbeing Interaction Design class at
        Washington University were tasked with developing a solution to address
        the nutritional needs of residents at the Crown Center.
      </p>
      <h3>Crown Center</h3>
      <p>
        The Crown Center opened in 1967 with the promise to serve residents
        under their founding Jewish principles. Residents are primarily Russian,
        Chinese, and white Americans, but the Crown Center is home to a
        diversity of people and cultures. The center offers Kosher meals
        available through their café on the main floor, and often shuffles
        between “special” meal nights that suit non-traditional kosher tastes.
        In addition to these services, the center offers a community gardening
        space where residents can harvest their own vegetables and spices.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Upon conducting research about the satisfaction of the dining
        experiences at the Crown center, we recognized that the food options
        were limiting some residents, and in fact shying them away from the
        café. Many residents do not eat at the café due to a lack of flavor and
        strict kosher rules. Instead, many residents took to cooking for
        themselves in their personal spaces. These residents are prompted to eat
        alone for several reasons, including having the option to cook to their
        preferred taste, to avoid social awkwardness, and out of general
        convenience.
      </p>
      <h2>PROJECT</h2>
      <h3>Users and Audience</h3>
      <p>
        To advise a different structure to the dining experience at the Crown
        Center is a very challenging task given our positions as undergraduate
        students. We instead saw an opportunity to design a tool for seniors who
        prefer to eat by themselves. Our apps users are residents who want to
        cook for themselves. Our app considers the health and well-being of
        residents by advising recipes based on their health needs, and my
        prompting goal setting and achieving to improve traditional health
        problems associated with foods
      </p>
      <p>The prime motivations to access our app are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look up a recipe</li>
        <li>Input/Track a goal</li>
        <li>Customize an order at the crown center</li>
        <li>Manage personal profile</li>
        <li>Share meals (with pics) to a community thread</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Failures and Pivots</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>
        These developed personas describe what typical residents of the Crown
        center using this app are like. Describing the personalities and
        tendencies of these characters gives a great insight to how a resident
        would use our app. Our app is projected to be the most successful for
        older residents who are physically able to cook for themselves and who
        seek to accomplish their dietary goals over an extended period of time.

      <h3>Sitemap</h3>

      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        These wireframes were sketched by Bersabeh. She visualized the journey
        throughout the app by organizing where the main features would exist
        under the navigation. The navigation separates the functions of the
        profile, the goal setting, and the recipe look up.
