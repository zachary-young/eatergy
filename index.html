      <h2 data-aos="fade-in" id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Context</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Students from the Understanding Health and Wellbeing Interaction Design class at
        Washington University were tasked with developing a solution to address
        the nutritional needs of residents at the Crown Center.
      </p>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Crown Center</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        The Crown Center opened in 1967 with the promise to serve residents
        under their founding Jewish principles. Residents are primarily Russian,
        Chinese, and white Americans, but the Crown Center is home to a
        diversity of people and cultures. The center offers Kosher meals
        available through their café on the main floor, and often shuffles
        between “special” meal nights that suit non-traditional kosher tastes.
        In addition to these services, the center offers a community gardening
        space where residents can harvest their own vegetables and spices.
      </p>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Problem Statement</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Upon conducting research about the satisfaction of the dining
        experiences at the Crown center, we recognized that the food options
        were limiting some residents, and in fact shying them away from the
        café. Many residents do not eat at the café due to a lack of flavor and
        strict kosher rules. Instead, many residents took to cooking for
        themselves in their personal spaces. These residents are prompted to eat
        alone for several reasons, including having the option to cook to their
        preferred taste, to avoid social awkwardness, and out of general
        convenience.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="ideation.png" />
      <h2 data-aos="fade-in" id="research">RESEARCH</h2>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Interviews</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        In our interviews with Crown Center residents, a few themes emerged, as
        shown in the map above. One theme was cliques. The residents often sat
        at the same place whenever they attended the cafe and sat with the same
        people. This proved problematic for seniors who wanted to meet new
        people. Moreover, nutrition was a concern for our interviewees, one of
        whom was prediabetic and needed to monitor their food intake. Our other
        interviewee did not have any dietary restrictions but noted that a lot
        of residents did have restrictions such as a non-gluten diet. A third
        theme was the tendency to eat alone because it was more convenient.
        Residents could put on their own music, watch their own shows, or cook
        their favorite meals.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Interview subject A (we will refer to her as Susan) is an elderly woman
        who moved to the Crown center in 2016. She estimates eating at the Crown
        Center cafe about 8 times a month, often for breakfast, because they
        open early.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Interview subject B (we will refer to him as Thomas) is an elderly
        pre-diabetic man who moved to the Crown Center in 2012. He says he has
        benefitted from the educational programs about nutrition that are
        offered at the Crown Center. He learned to change his diet by eating
        more vegetables and fruits and less sweets and carbonated drinks. After
        having been told of his pre-diabetic condition, Thomas made efforts to
        improve his eating behaviors but he admitted to still eating junk foods
        every once in a while.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Susan used to eat “anything” because she was physically active. After
        being limited to a wheelchair, she became cautious of the foods she eats
        out of fear of gaining weight. Thomas and Susan both enjoy the beef stew
        and chili offered at the cafe a few times a month. They share feelings
        of dissatisfaction about the rest of the under-seasoned meals. They were
        both unhappy about cafe hours, stating that they closed much too early
        for dinner. Thomas goes down to the cafe when he feels like engaging
        socially, but Susan rarely visits the cafe because of the awkward set up
        of cliques, describing that there is no excitement to seeing the same
        people every day. Instead, she enjoys the company of music, tv, or radio
        from the privacy of her home. Susan points out that a lot of other
        people don’t know how to use smartphones, tablets, Youtube/social media,
        or avoid them to support their simpler lifestyles. Susan enjoys Youtube
        because she sees many cooking shows and learns new recipes to try for
        herself. Thomas similarly enjoys watching Youtube for DIY and how-to-fix
        videos.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        When he is not using instacart for grocery delivery, Thomas takes
        advantage of the mini bus transportation service offered through the
        Crown Center to shop and to also exercise. He walks for a designated
        time to meet his daily exercise goals. When asking Susan and Thomas
        about what sort of app platform would be most useful to them, they both
        wanted a tool that would help them plan and organize their meals in
        order to lose weight or improve an existing health condition. Susan
        wanted to plan her meals for her week and also learn new recipes to
        accommodate her adventurous taste palette. Thomas wanted to avoid
        becoming diabetic, so he wished for an app that would encourage more
        healthy eating, and wanted to educate himself on what was could be
        considered”middle ground” for both his cravings and his health. Both
        Susan and Thomas own smartphones and a tablet/laptop, and were decently
        versed in how to use these technologies.
      </p>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Secondary Research</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Additionally, our secondary research gave us further insights into
        technology use and nutrition within the senior population. In regards to
        technology use, Rick interviewed his grandparents and other seniors
        where he found a couple trends. He noticed that a lot of seniors had
        smartphones, but laptop use also seemed to be prevalent among the senior
        population. Rick also found that not all seniors were comfortable using
        bluetooth technology. Zach then researched statistics on the aging
        demographic and came up with a few different observations. He discovered
        that as seniors aged, they become less adaptible to changing
        environments as stated by the Environment-Docility Hypothesis.
        Consequentially, it can be more difficult for seniors to adapt to new
        technology and incorporate it into their lifestyle. Another interesting
        finding was found in a pilot study done by Meals on Wheels, which found
        that at-home food delivery methods with personal contact provides
        long-term health benefits when compared to dropship food delivery method
        among elders. Not only socialization important, but the nutrition
        provided to seniors is also important. Here is a graph displaying the
        prevalence of obesity among seniors.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="obesity.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Bersabeh then researched emerging technologies in modern products.
        Research has revealed that seniors enjoy voice technology. Apple’s Siri
        and Amazon’s Alexa are both successful voice activated aids that search
        the internet for answers to questions one might have. These features
        need not only be implemented through a phone, but can also function as,
        for example, a bed sensor that can sense when someone gets up to greet
        and give a run down of the day. It is estimated that by 2050, seniors
        aged 50 and over will make 20% of the population, thus giving a high
        market for technology for seniors. Streamlining government data and
        personal data will help medical caregivers better assess the situations
        of older patients. These technologies can access information from
        medical records and information input by a patient to give health care
        away from the clinic. Apps like Fooducate, Calorie Counter,
        MyFitnessPal, and countless others all function to monitor food and
        exercise intake based on the information input by a user. For
        nutrition/exercise focused apps, users typically must input their
        measurements, pre-existing health conditions, weight loss/lifestyle
        goals, and then must continue to input food/water intake, including
        portions, calories, vitamin counts, exercise type, exercise duration. To
        give accurate assessments, it’s likely that a user must consistently log
        information about every meal/activity. These events become tiresome, and
        eventually a user may grow tired of the commitment to the app, and their
        goals.
      </p>
      <h2 data-aos="fade-in" id="project">PROJECT</h2>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Users and Audience</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        To advise a different structure to the dining experience at the Crown
        Center is a very challenging task given our positions as undergraduate
        students. We instead saw an opportunity to design a tool for seniors who
        prefer to eat by themselves. Our apps users are residents who want to
        cook for themselves. Our app considers the health and well-being of
        residents by advising recipes based on their health needs, and my
        prompting goal setting and achieving to improve traditional health
        problems associated with foods
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">The prime motivations to access our app are to:</p>
      <ul data-aos="fade-in">
        <li>Look up a recipe</li>
        <li>Input/Track a goal</li>
        <li>Manage personal profile</li>
        <li>Share meals (with pics) to a community thread</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Failures and Pivots</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        During the ideation phase, we came up with two ideas. One idea was an
        all-in-one voice assistant for Crown Center residents to place orders
        and view their schedule/plan events in accordance with Crown Center's
        schedules. The app would also provide options to provide feedback on
        events and track nutrition. The second idea was our current idea:
        Eatergy. The reason we went with Eatergy rather our Crown virtual
        assistant is because we found that the Crown virtual assistant tried to
        tackle too many problems at once. By adding so much functionality to our
        app, we believed it would dilute the purpose of our app. We wanted our
        app to have a focused purpose. That's why we made Eatergy which focuses
        on meal planning, goal setting, and recipe suggestions.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Our initial idea was to have an app that interacted both with residents
        at Crown Center and an external nutritionist. Moreover, the main way a
        client would interact with the nutrionist was through a picture-based
        sharing system. However, this proved problematic as it would be
        difficult for a nutrionist to tell what was inside of a meal by just
        looking at it. Additionally, this overhead cost of hiring a nutrionist
        to handle many different users was too much. Here are some wireframes
        from Bersabeh and a more fleshed out version by Rick (Note that these
        are not our final deliverables since we decided to move on from the
        nutriionist idea and focus on nutrition/goal tracking):
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="sketch.png" />
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="wireframe.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Zach also made this prototype a little more interactive in a Figma
        wireframe which can be viewed with the bottom right button.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="figma.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        We also had some issues presenting our case study. Rick first put up our
        work in an Adobe Portfolio as shown
        <a href="https://eatergy.myportfolio.com/home">here</a>, but then we
        transitioned to a custom-built website by Zach for greater customization
        and a linear layout
      </p>
      <h2 data-aos="fade-in" id="outcome">OUTCOME</h2>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Personas</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        These developed personas describe what typical residents of the Crown
        center using this app are like. Describing the personalities and
        tendencies of these characters gives a great insight to how a resident
        would use our app. Our app is projected to be the most successful for
        older residents who are physically able to cook for themselves and who
        seek to accomplish their dietary goals over an extended period of time.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="personas.png" />
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Storyboard</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        We designed this storyboard to exemplify an example scenario in which
        our app would be used
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="storyboard.png" />
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Sitemap</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Our sitemap is designed for accessibility to most functionality of our
        app within a few clicks. Moreover, we added a virtual assistant to ease
        the transition to our technology.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="sitemap.png" />
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Wireframes</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        We designed this rough prototype to help our users get a better
        understanding of our goals for this project.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="prototype.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        While our prototype is in mobile, we hope to expand to web as well for
        easier accessibility. We understand that not everyone at the Crown
        Center has a smartphone, but there are computers for them to use if they
        wish.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="website.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Here is a breakdown of our prototype by section:
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="setup.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        This app helps us setup the user with basic health information and
        dietary information so we make the appropriate recipe suggestion based
        on our algorithm. Also, ExpressScripts noted that seniors may be
        uncomfortable sharing sensitive health information. To address this, we
        specify in the notes that the information will be kept completely
        anonymous.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="home.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        This sequence shows how a user can manage their meal planning and goals
        on their main page. The calendar on the bottom portion of the screen
        shows full circles where the user has prepared meals. The blank circles
        show future meals to be prepped. This metric helps users feel a sense of
        accomplishment when preparing meals to achieve their goals. In addition,
        Users can click on each goal and be led
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="virtualassistant.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        This screen serves as the voice assistant for our app. Since voice
        technology is becoming more popular among seniors, we want our app to be
        easily accessible by providing the same functionality through a voice
        assistant.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="socialization.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Since our research showed that socialization is an important factor of a
        senior's mental health, we decided it be a great feature if we could
        incorporate socialization within our app. Therefore, we added the
        ability to share one's recipes or meals that they have planned. Users
        are able to message others and leave reviews on others recipes. This
        keeps Crown Center's residents connected together even when cooking
        alone in their apartment.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="search.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        The search page simply allows users to search for different recipes if
        they are not satisfied with the recommended recipes shown in the next
        sequence.
      </p>
      <img data-aos="fade-in" src="recipe.png" />
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        In this sequence, we suggest recipes based on their goals and dietary
        needs. After preparing a given recipe, users are given the opportunity
        to share the recipe with others and more.
      </p>
      <h2 data-aos="fade-in" id="logistics">LOGISTICS</h2>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        The work in this project was split evenly among the team members: Rick,
        Bersabeh, and Zach. Bersabeh helped sketch out the initial wireframes.
        Rick helped design our first iteration of the eatergy prototype in
        Illustrator. Zach expanded upon Rick's wireframes in Figma by creating
        an interactive prototype. Zach constructed the initial storyboard and
        Bersabeh made the first personas. However, as the project evolved and we
        changed the purpose of our app, we needed to create new visuals for our
        app. In our final product, Rick created our now final prototype.
        Bersabeh and Zach revised our initial storyboard, sitemap, and personas.
        Zach was also responsible for the development of the case study website.
      </p>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Scope and Constraints</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        We think the greatest constraint on our team for this project was time.
        Since we were split across 3 different timezones (EDT,CDT,and KST -
        Korea), we had to communicate within the very short window of time we
        were all awake. This made it difficult to communicate. However, after
        delegating tasks within that window, we each used the rest of our day to
        complete our designated responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Moreover, the online learning environment put a strain on our
        productivity. Since we had to collaborate online, all of us had to
        quickly learn how to use Figma so we could work on artifacts in
        real-time.
      </p>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-in">Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-in">
        We learned that design is an iterative process. It's not linear. While
        generally projects follow a pattern of ideation, synthesis, prototyping,
        and design, the path can often become obscured by failures and
        obstacles. We faced issues in our first idea and the nutrionist component after realizing
        that our app had become diluted by too many ideas. So we had to go back
        to the drawing board and restart.
