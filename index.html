      <h1>EATERGY</h1>
      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        Students from Health and Wellbeing Interaction Design class at
        Washington University were tasked with developing a solution to address
        the nutritional needs of residents at the Crown Center.
      </p>
      <h3>Crown Center</h3>
      <p>
        The Crown Center opened in 1967 with the promise to serve residents
        under their founding Jewish principles. Residents are primarily Russian,
        Chinese, and white Americans, but the Crown Center is home to a
        diversity of people and cultures. The center offers Kosher meals
        available through their café on the main floor, and often shuffles
        between “special” meal nights that suit non-traditional kosher tastes.
        In addition to these services, the center offers a community gardening
        space where residents can harvest their own vegetables and spices.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Upon conducting research about the satisfaction of the dining
        experiences at the Crown center, we recognized that the food options
        were limiting some residents, and in fact shying them away from the
        café. Many residents do not eat at the café due to a lack of flavor and
        strict kosher rules. Instead, many residents took to cooking for
        themselves in their personal spaces. These residents are prompted to eat
        alone for several reasons, including having the option to cook to their
        preferred taste, to avoid social awkwardness, and out of general
        convenience.

      <h2>PROJECT</h2>
      <h3>Users and Audience</h3>
      <p>
        To advise a different structure to the dining experience at the Crown
        Center is a very challenging task given our positions as undergraduate
        students. We instead saw an opportunity to design a tool for seniors who
        prefer to eat by themselves. Our apps users are residents who want to
        cook for themselves. Our app considers the health and well-being of
        residents by advising recipes based on their health needs, and my
        prompting goal setting and achieving to improve traditional health
        problems associated with foods
      </p>
      <p>The prime motivations to access our app are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look up a recipe</li>
        <li>Input/Track a goal</li>
        <li>Manage personal profile</li>
        <li>Share meals (with pics) to a community thread</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Failures and Pivots</h3>
      <p>
        Our initial idea was to have an app that interacted both with residents
        at Crown Center and an external nutritionist. Moreover, the main way a client would interact with the nutrionist was through a picture-based sharing system. However, this proved problematic as it would be difficult for a nutrionist to tell what was inside of a meal by just looking at it. Additionally, this overhead cost of hiring a nutrionist to handle many different users was too much. Here are some wireframes from Bersabeh and a more fleshed out version by Rick:

      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>
        These developed personas describe what typical residents of the Crown
        center using this app are like. Describing the personalities and
        tendencies of these characters gives a great insight to how a resident
        would use our app. Our app is projected to be the most successful for
        older residents who are physically able to cook for themselves and who
        seek to accomplish their dietary goals over an extended period of time.

      <h3>Storyboard</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Sitemap</h3>
      <p>
        Our sitemap is designed for accessibility to most functionality of our
        app within a few clicks. Moreover, we added a virtual assistant to ease
        the transition to our technology.
      </p>

      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        We designed this rough prototype to help our users get a better
        understanding of our goals for this project.
      </p>
      <img src="prototype.png.png" />
      <p>
        While our prototype is in mobile, we hope to expand to web as well for
        easier accessibility. We understand that not everyone at the Crown
        Center has a smartphone, but there are computers for them to use if they
        wish.

      <h2>LOGISTICS</h2>
      <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        The work in this project was split evenly among the team members: Rick,
        Bersabeh, and Zach. Bersabeh helped sketch out the initial wireframes.
        Rick helped design our first iteration of the eatergy prototype in
        Illustrator. Zach expanded upon Rick's wireframes in Figma by creating
        an interactive prototype. Zach constructed the initial storyboard and
        Bersabeh made the first personas. However, as the project evolved and we
        changed the purpose of our app, we needed to create new visuals for our
        app. In our final product, Rick created our now final prototype.
        Bersabeh and Zach revised our initial storyboard, sitemap, and personas.
        Zach was also responsible for the development of the case study website.
      </p>
      <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        We think the greatest constraint on our team for this project was time.
        Since we were split across 3 different timezones (EDT,CDT,and KST -
        Korea), we had to communicate within the very short window of time we
        were all awake. This made it difficult to communicate. However, after
        delegating tasks within that window, we each used the rest of our day to
        complete our designated responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the online learning environment put a strain on our
        productivity. Since we had to collaborate online, all of us had to
        quickly learn how to use Figma so we could work on artifacts in
        real-time.
      </p>
      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        We learned that design is an iterative process. It's not linear. While
        generally projects follow a pattern of ideation, synthesis, prototyping,
        and design, the path can often become obscured by failures and
        obstacles. We faced issues in our first the nutrionist after realizing
        that our app had become diluted by too many ideas. So we had to go back
        to the drawing board and restart.
